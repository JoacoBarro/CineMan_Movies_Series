# 🎬 CINEMAN

**CINEMAN** is a movie and TV series discovery web application built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, powered by real-time data from the **IMDb API**.  
The application includes advanced client-side features such as persistent favorites, infinite scrolling, search, filtering, and modal-based content exploration across a multi-page interface.

The entire project was developed using **Cursor** as an AI-assisted development tool.

## 🔑 API Key Notice

This project consumes the IMDb API from the client side.

For portfolio and demo purposes, the API key is referenced directly in the frontend code.
In a production environment, this would be handled through a backend service or environment variables to avoid exposing sensitive credentials.
